# Hockey GM Legacy – Codex v1.0

**Tagline:** You are not building a hockey team. You are building hockey lives.

Hockey GM Legacy is a living hockey universe simulator where the player builds a lifelong executive career, beginning in junior hockey and potentially rising through the professional ranks.

2. [Manifesto](docs/00-charter/MANIFESTO.md)

4. [MVP Scope](docs/00-charter/MVP_V1_SCOPE.md)
5. [Rule Engine Implementation Spec](docs/09-implementation-specs/RULE_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md)

## Current Implementation Anchor

The current implementation is focused on standalone LegacyEngine modules:

- Rule Engine
- Owners
- Scouting
- People
- Relationships
- Events
- World
- Recruiting
- Contracts
- Draft
- Rosters
- Player Development
- Injuries
- Alpha Integration
- Alpha Console
- Human Intelligence
- Alpha Daily Simulation Pipeline
- Alpha Desktop

Alpha 1.1 - GM Character Creation + First GM Actions starts AlphaDesktop on a GM creation screen, then drops the created GM into the Prairie Falcons scenario two weeks before the draft. The player can review the club, re-rank the draft board, assign a scout focus, make a recruiting offer, and advance days to process responses.

Inbox v2 organizes GM messages into category tabs, supports read/unread, archive, delete, and pin state, and keeps Event Engine history intact.

Alpha 1.2 refines the desktop inbox into an email-style GM workspace with a category sidebar, message list, reading pane, row-level actions, and local filters.

## Alpha Console

Run the engine-only playtest harness:

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/AlphaConsole
```

Run the basic desktop UI:

```bash
dotnet run --project client/AlphaDesktop
```

The desktop playtest harness starts with Alpha 1.1 GM creation. Smoke tests and the console harness keep a Jordan Hayes fallback when no custom GM is supplied.

Available commands:

- `help`
- `status`
- `inbox`
- `owner`
- `staff`
- `roster`
- `recruits`
- `scouting`
- `draftboard`
- `relationships`
- `advance`
- `advance 7`
- `exit`

## Architecture Pillars

1. Legacy Engine — the living world.
2. Event Engine — what happens.
3. Human Intelligence System — how people think.
4. Communication Engine — who knows what.
5. Rule Engine — what each league allows.
