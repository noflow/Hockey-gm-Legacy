# Hockey GM Legacy – Codex v1.0

**Tagline:** You are not building a hockey team. You are building hockey lives.

Hockey GM Legacy is a living hockey universe simulator where the player builds a lifelong executive career, beginning in junior hockey and potentially rising through the professional ranks.

## Start Here

1. [Project Charter](docs/00-charter/PROJECT_CHARTER.md)
2. [Manifesto](docs/00-charter/MANIFESTO.md)
3. [Documentation Index](docs/INDEX.md)
4. [MVP Scope](docs/00-charter/MVP_V1_SCOPE.md)
5. [Rule Engine Implementation Spec](docs/09-implementation-specs/RULE_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC.md)

## Current Implementation Anchor

The current implementation is focused on standalone LegacyEngine modules:

- Rule Engine
- Owners
- Scouting
- People
- Relationships
- Events
- World
- Recruiting
- Contracts
- Draft
- Rosters
- Player Development

Milestone 013 - Player Development v1 tracks hidden current ability, hidden potential, development stages, development attributes, monthly development updates, and development events without exposing true ratings through dossier-facing output.
